        <p>Today's recipe is going to be one that you don't wanna miss. Say <em>hello</em> to <strong>my favorite</strong> sweet salmon recipe. Let's get started, shall we?</p>

            <li>olive oil spray</li>

        <h2>How to Make the Best Salmon of Your Life</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your pan at med-high heat with some olive oil spray for a couple minutes beforehand. Gather all your materials. Make sure the chicken is placed in a sizeable bowl so that you can mix your seasoning well.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your seasoning (around 2-3 tsp of Badia Complete Seasoning) onto the salmon as evenly as you can.</li>
            <li>Use your hands (sanitize them beforehand, obviously) to mix the seasoning well into the salmon. Add in a couple slaps for good measure, if you'd like.</li>
            <li>Place seasoned salmon onto already-warm pan. Should make fierce <em>sheee sparkle sparkle</em> noise once placed.</li>
            <li>Allow salmon to cook. Cover with lid if you please for more even distribution or whatever.</li>
            <li>After 30s-1min, flip salmon. Spread approx. 1tsp of barbeque sauce on your salmon. Put a little bit of lemon juice/lime juice onto salmon as you please.</li>
            <li>Allow salmon to cook for a couple more minutes, or until it is as done as you'd like it.</li>
            <li>Say <em>mama mia!</em>, blow a kiss and enjoy your pescado frrr.</li>
        </ol>
