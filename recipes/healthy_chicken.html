        <h2>Searing hot garlic chicken with low fats!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my favorite chicken recipe. This delicious garlic chicken recipe is my go-to, and has been, for <em><strong>years!</strong></em></p>
        <p>In order to make this recipe come to life, you should have a couple ingredients at hand. Make sure you have your <strong>chicken, seasoning (I use Badia Complete Seasoning), lemon juice, olive oil spray, and some plates!</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 tsp seasoning powder of your choice</li>
            <li>olive oil spray</li>
            <li>lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Make the Best Chicken of Your Life</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your pan at med-high heat with some olive oil spray for a couple minutes beforehand. Gather all your materials. Make sure the chicken is placed in a sizeable bowl so that you can mix your seasoning well.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your seasoning (around 2-3 tsp of Badia Complete Seasoning) onto the chicken as evenly as you can.</li>
            <li>Use your hands (sanitize them beforehand, obviously) to mix the seasoning well into the chicken. Add in a couple slaps for good measure, if you'd like.</li>
            <li>Place seasoned chicken onto already-warm pan. Should make fierce <em>sheee sparkle sparkle</em> noise once placed.</li>
            <li>Allow chicken to cook. Cover with lid if you please for more even distribution or whatever.</li>
            <li>After 30s-1min, flip chicken. Put a little bit of lemon juice/lime juice onto chicken as you please.</li>
            <li>Allow chicken to cook for a couple more minutes, or until it is as done as you'd like it.</li>
            <li>Say <em>mama mia!</em>, blow a kiss and enjoy your pollo frrr.</li>
        </ol>
